## Company profile
The company profile is a section where you can view important details about a company, and you can find it by selecting the company from the list. It contains the company’s username, profile picture, location, and registration ID. The profile also has three tabs: the "Basic Details" tab shows personal information, the "Team Members" tab lists team-related details, and the third tab allows you to add extra menu items for customization.
