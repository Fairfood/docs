This section provides an overview of how assesses deforestation risks. It follows specific standards such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and Rainforest Alliance guidelines. Measures tree cover loss within a 113-meter radius around farms and monitors protected areas within a 2-kilometer proximity. Key indicators include the total area of tree cover loss, the number of events leading to deforestation, and losses in protected areas. These assessments help identify the impact across various certification schemes like Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade, and EUDR.

This section presents a demographic and agricultural overview of Honduras. It highlights the countryâ€™s population distribution, with a significant portion engaged in agriculture, which contributes notably to the GDP. Key metrics include the number of agricultural cooperatives, the total and average farm plot sizes, and the gender distribution of farmers. It also reviews essential financial indicators like living income prices, production costs, and yield rates. Farmers are categorized based on economic performance, with groups defined by income, production costs, and productivity levels.
