### Color system

Our colour scheme is built up around Fairfood’s own primary colours. But to create a more serious (B2B) palette that has a broader use, we’ve added a lighterand a darker blue.
We’re about blockchain, and about transparency. Taking this literally gives us a great style element to work with.

In the digital world, a color palette is a collection of colors and tools for use in paint and drawing software, or it may refer to the entire spectrum of colors that can be displayed on a device screen or other interface. The color scheme of a product or technological advancement reveals a lot about its electronic design and its visual qualities for human users.

Icons should be used in a purposeful manner to maximize comprehension and reduce cognitive load when you need to call attention to a particular action, command, or section
We foresee three types of icons. ‘Explainer icons’ that we can use to illustrate our story for example. ‘Dashboard icons’ that we use to illustrate functionality or categories in our tool, 'Mobile app icons' which is used in our collector app.
