### All about your chain
Trace will automatically generate the product story for you when you create transactions. You can share this story with the world via a QR code or link.  Furthermore, you can customise the interface to match your brand's look and feel. Let's take a closer look at the elements of the storytelling interface.

Cover Area


This is the main area where people land when they follow your Trace link or QR code. This is where the key takeaways are located (title), along with your brand logo, a hero image, claims, a call to action, a share button, and project info is displayed.


Activities and  Projects


Do you want to communicate more than just the product narrative? Perhaps, some initiatives you have undertaken with the farming community or a success story. These can be highlighted in the Projects section, with or without extra stats.


Product Journey


Trace will automatically generate and map out the journey of your product based on the location of your partners and the information they have provided. It provides a straightforward overview of the entire supply chain behind your product.


In addition to locations, Trace will also outline the stages of the product journey step by step. This feature enables you to provide a more in-depth description of your supply chain partners, including the events that took place at each stage, information about the product at that moment, as well as when and where they occurred.



Video


Do you wish to discuss more about the product or go beyond the product itself? You can always do so in the video section by adding your YouTube video (or another image).


### Customise to your aesthetics
Before developing a custom storytelling page, Fairfood's design team will work with you to incorporate your house-style colours into the page, and send you a few options to choose from.  Let's explore the details of each area and the customisation options.
