    Are you tired of trying to remember yet another password for yet another login? Well, you'll be happy to hear that the Trace system has done away with the need for passwords altogether! Now, you can log in using your Gmail account, or simply enter your email address to receive a magic link or code. It's that easy! No more fussing with forgotten passwords or worrying about the security risks they pose.


But wait, there's more! While the traditional password-based login is still available, Trace is gradually phasing it out in favour of more modern and secure authentication methods. With the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, keeping your data and information safe is more important than ever.

    Since the inception of Trace, we have relied on SMS as a means of communication but encountered challenges along the way. While SMS initially offered the advantage of accessibility for feature phone users, it has become apparent over the years that this solution lacks scalability. As a result, we have made the decision to shift our focus to WhatsApp.


    We have developed a chatbot within WhatsApp, empowering farmers to conveniently access various services. Through this chatbot, farmers can effortlessly check their sales history using their card ID, revoke consent if desired, and report any issues. Although this approach may not be bulletproof, we firmly believe that leveraging WhatsApp provides a highly scalable and reliable solution.

    We have streamlined the farmer profile to create a centralized platform for managing companies to access and organize all relevant information pertaining to farmers. The revamped farmer profile now features multiple tabs, each serving a specific purpose. The first tab presents essential farmer details, including various identification numbers such as Trace ID, farmer card number, co-op IDs, and more. The second tab, labelled "Farm," enables users to view farm locations and polygons associated with each farmer. In the third tab, named "Income," all farmer payments are listed for easy reference. The fourth tab, designated as "Documents," allows for efficient management of farmer-related documents. Additionally, we have emphasized the consent status of each farmer, ensuring clear visibility and understanding. These enhancements provide managing companies with a comprehensive and organized view of farmers' profiles, facilitating efficient decision-making and effective communication.

    We are thrilled to announce the successful update of our mobile app to the latest version of React. Furthermore, we have seamlessly migrated our mobile database from Watermelon DB to Realm DB. While utilizing Watermelon DB in the app, we encountered certain limitations and bottlenecks that prompted this transition.


    By upgrading to the latest version of React and integrating Realm DB, we have significantly enhanced the performance and efficiency of our mobile app. This update ensures a smoother user experience and allows for improved scalability and flexibility in managing data. We are excited about these advancements and the positive impact they will have on our users.

    To provide a comprehensive overview of your product story, it is essential to include sources that may not be completely traceable. Recognizing this need, we have made the decision to incorporate such sources alongside your fully traceable product journey.

    
    This expansion allows for the inclusion of use cases where a significant ingredient is fully traceable, while smaller ingredients may not possess complete traceability. By incorporating these diverse sources into the Trace storytelling interface, we can enhance transparency and offer a more comprehensive narrative.


    Our aim is to present the complete picture of your product's origins, ensuring transparency at every step. By acknowledging and showcasing the inclusion of various sources, we enable you to convey the complexities of your supply chain while maintaining a commitment to transparency.
