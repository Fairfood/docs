    Are you tired of trying to remember yet another password for yet another login? Well, you'll be happy to hear that the Trace system has done away with the need for passwords altogether! Now, you can log in using your Gmail account, or simply enter your email address to receive a magic link or code. It's that easy! No more fussing with forgotten passwords or worrying about the security risks they pose.


But wait, there's more! While the traditional password-based login is still available, Trace is gradually phasing it out in favour of more modern and secure authentication methods. With the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, keeping your data and information safe is more important than ever.

   Our NFC-based farmer card, which is used to verify payments and procurement activities, has received a lot of attention in the traceability industry. This card allows farmers to tap it for easy verification and digitalisation, and the NFC technology adds an extra layer of security as it is not easily replaceable. However, a major drawback of NFC cards is that they require phones with NFC capabilities, which are more expensive than basic smartphones.


To address this issue, we have developed a QR code-based verification system in addition to the existing NFC verification and photo of receipt process, which is integrated into our Trace collector mobile application. This enables card verification from any app-supported Android-based phones with a camera, and will be available in the new farmer cards. Collectors can use the QR code to verify transactions, and farmers can scan it to view their digital transaction history.


While QR codes are more easily replicable, we have taken measures to ensure authenticity by collecting the geo-coordinates of the card tap.

   Imagine having a powerful tool at your fingertips that allows you to assess the impact of your work, track your progress, and support your users better. That's precisely what our newly enhanced admin dashboard offers!


Our team worked tirelessly towards the end of 2022 to bring about a complete transformation of the dashboard, and by mid-January 2023, we had achieved the full potential of this tool. Now, the Trace team has a powerful resource that enables them to monitor and summarize Trace activities with ease.


With the new and improved Trace dashboard, generating reports has never been more straightforward. It's an exciting development that will make a real difference in the way we work, giving us a vital edge in tracking KPIs and improving our overall performance.

   Welcome to the future of B2B storytelling - the Trace transaction report. Our newly created transaction report is a game-changer in the world of B2B storytelling. It's a single report that gathers all the data related to the product journey and the farmers involved in its creation, providing buyers with everything they need to know about the product they're purchasing.


But, we didn't just stop at data collection. We wanted to create a report that tells a story, a story of fairness, ethics, and transparency. Our transaction report provides a narrative-driven interface that helps buyers understand the brand's values and how they're reflected in the product they're buying.
