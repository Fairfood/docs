    The Trace mobile app has been enhanced to include the functionality of monitoring farmer-verified non-product-related payments. This update significantly expands the potential for verifying various types of payments, such as bonus payments and subsidies, either through the use of a card or by obtaining a receipt. Furthermore, the app is designed to automatically retrieve the location of the verification process, thus adding an additional layer of security and authenticity.

    Since the inception of Trace, we have relied on SMS as a means of communication but encountered challenges along the way. While SMS initially offered the advantage of accessibility for feature phone users, it has become apparent over the years that this solution lacks scalability. As a result, we have made the decision to shift our focus to WhatsApp.


    We have developed a chatbot within WhatsApp, empowering farmers to conveniently access various services. Through this chatbot, farmers can effortlessly check their sales history using their card ID, revoke consent if desired, and report any issues. Although this approach may not be bulletproof, we firmly believe that leveraging WhatsApp provides a highly scalable and reliable solution.

    We have streamlined the farmer profile to create a centralized platform for managing companies to access and organize all relevant information pertaining to farmers. The revamped farmer profile now features multiple tabs, each serving a specific purpose. The first tab presents essential farmer details, including various identification numbers such as Trace ID, farmer card number, co-op IDs, and more. The second tab, labelled "Farm," enables users to view farm locations and polygons associated with each farmer. In the third tab, named "Income," all farmer payments are listed for easy reference. The fourth tab, designated as "Documents," allows for efficient management of farmer-related documents. Additionally, we have emphasized the consent status of each farmer, ensuring clear visibility and understanding. These enhancements provide managing companies with a comprehensive and organized view of farmers' profiles, facilitating efficient decision-making and effective communication.

    We are thrilled to announce the successful update of our mobile app to the latest version of React. Furthermore, we have seamlessly migrated our mobile database from Watermelon DB to Realm DB. While utilizing Watermelon DB in the app, we encountered certain limitations and bottlenecks that prompted this transition.


    By upgrading to the latest version of React and integrating Realm DB, we have significantly enhanced the performance and efficiency of our mobile app. This update ensures a smoother user experience and allows for improved scalability and flexibility in managing data. We are excited about these advancements and the positive impact they will have on our users.

    To provide a comprehensive overview of your product story, it is essential to include sources that may not be completely traceable. Recognizing this need, we have made the decision to incorporate such sources alongside your fully traceable product journey.

    
    This expansion allows for the inclusion of use cases where a significant ingredient is fully traceable, while smaller ingredients may not possess complete traceability. By incorporating these diverse sources into the Trace storytelling interface, we can enhance transparency and offer a more comprehensive narrative.


    Our aim is to present the complete picture of your product's origins, ensuring transparency at every step. By acknowledging and showcasing the inclusion of various sources, we enable you to convey the complexities of your supply chain while maintaining a commitment to transparency.
