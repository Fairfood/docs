title: App APIs
description: "The app is currently functioning using data from our Trace servers. We are providing information about the API structure and data usage in order to assist you in connecting to your servers."

### Common structure 
All our APIs are designed according to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). Our APIs typically exposes a set of resources like, farmers, companies and the transactions and allows clients to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on those resources using HTTP verbs (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).


### Request headers

All our API requests except login contain the following parameters in addition to the standard APIs headers,


Bearer : Token received during the authentication 

User-ID : ID of the user logged in

Node-ID: ID of the user's company

Version: Application version 

Client-Code: client specific code assigned from the server



### Request headers
All our API requests except login contain the following parameters in addition to the standard APIs headers,


Bearer : Token received during the authentication 

User-ID : ID of the user logged in

Node-ID: ID of the user's company

Version: Application version 

Client-Code: client specific code assigned from the server



### Response
API responses contain meta data about the  response and the detail requested. 

success : Boolean values with the request status

detail : Status message


code: Http status code

data: Response data


- In addition to that we are using the following pagination setup

count: total number of the object matching the get query

next: next page URL (null if there is no next page)

previous: previous page URL (null if there is no next page)


```javascript 
{
 	"success": true,
 	"detail": "Success fetched data",
 	"code": 200,
 	"data": {
 		"count": 15,
		"next": "{root}/products/?limit=10&offset=10",
		"previous": null,
		"results": [ {... },  {... }  {... } ]
 	}
}

```

### Common filters
For the GET APIs we are using the following pagination filters

limit: Number of items per page we can request

offset: starting index of the page

ast_modified: the last date the object modified. This will help us to fetch just the modified items and optimise synching(only fetch items modified after yesterdayâ€™s synching)






### Common filters
Our error responses are have the following formats,

```javascript 
{
 	"success": false,
 	"detail": "Invalid Bearer token or User-Id, please re-login.",
 	"code": 401,
 	"data": {}
}


```
