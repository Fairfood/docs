## Trace
Trace provides transparency on the data collected and shared by supply chain partners. When all partners willingly share price data, Trace can offer that level of transparency. However, it is essential to recognize that complete data sharing might not always be feasible or preferable in all situations. Some partners may choose not to share certain information due to various reasons, and that decision must be respected. The goal is to strike a balance between transparency and respecting the privacy and preferences of the involved stakeholders..
