      - At the top of the dashboard, you can see key numbers like the total count of farmers, companies, supply chains, and the length of the chain. This gives a quick summary of the entire system.  
      - A map is displayed below, showing the locations of farmers and suppliers. It also includes details and statistics related to these actors, making it easy to understand their role in the supply chain.  
      - Below the map, there is a section that provides details about products in stock and recent transactions. This helps you keep track of inventory and recent trade activities.  
      - At the bottom of the dashboard, you can find a list of recent activities and tasks that need attention. This ensures you stay updated on changes and can address any important actions promptly.
