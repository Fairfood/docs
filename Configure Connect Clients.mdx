## 5.Dynamic Forms and Field Configuration

If we need to add any field other than inbuilt fields we can add them from Django Admin. Like if we need any extra field while doing transactions we will create a form with form type 'transaction' which enables the extra fields in the form. In order to reflect instantly in the app run 'Hot Fix' from settings. ie, we need to add custom transaction date we create a form with form field label as 'Transaction Date', field type as 'Date' and key as 'transaction_date'

**Form Type**
- Transactions - add extra fields while doing transaction in connect application
- Payments - add extra fields while making payments in connect application
- Farmer - add extra fields while registering farmer in connect application
- Products - add extra fields while creating product in connect application.

Each form is defined in the Form model, and its fields can be customized using the **Form Field**.

## üí∞ Transactions Interface

All transactions involving buying or selling are recorded and visible under the **Transactions tab** in the application. Users can view the transaction history, but it is important to note that the mobile app only shows **transactions that were synced since the last successful synchronization**. This helps reduce app load time and ensures better offline usability.

The full set of transaction records is available in the **Connect Web Application**, which is designed for more comprehensive data review and administration.

Users can also:

- Filter transactions based on various parameters
- Export the data to CSV


---

## üîÑ Synchronization and Offline Mode

The application is designed to function both **online and offline**, which is critical in rural or low-connectivity environments.

When working offline, any transaction that is performed is stored locally on the device. Once an internet connection becomes available, the system automatically attempts to sync these records with the database.

There are two key options provided for manual synchronization:

1. **Sync**: This option appears in the top-right corner of the app and can be used to manually push pending data to the server if automatic syncing fails.
2. **Hot Sync**: This is a more advanced sync feature used to reset listing and reference data in the mobile app from the database. It **does not delete any database data**. It is especially useful if there are inconsistencies or issues in the mobile data and a fresh pull from the server is required.

---

## üë§ Profile and User Preferences

Under the **Profile tab**, users can update their own personal information. In addition to personal details, users can  customize how the app behaves and displays data.

Settings available include:

- Changing the application language
- Adjusting number formats (e.g., decimal separators, digit grouping)
- Enabling or disabling transaction announcements (e.g., audio or on-screen prompts)

These customizations help improve usability for users operating in different regions or with different preferences.
