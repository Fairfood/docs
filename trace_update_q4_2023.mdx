   Our initial goal was to become 'open-source ready' by the end of 2023. However, with the support and collaboration from CISCO and other dynamic partners, we managed to fast-track our efforts, and successfully open-sourced our entire tech platforms onto GitHub ahead of schedule. While we're proud of this significant accomplishment, there's still work ahead. Our next exciting challenge is to enhance the platform's developer-friendliness, aiming to enable one-click self-hosting. This step will further streamline the experience for our users and broaden the impact of our open-source initiative.
