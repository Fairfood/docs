## API Reference and User Guide available on [Read the Docs](docs.fairfood.org)


## Example Usage

#### Initialization

Initialize the connect object with the required parameters: base_url, 
client_id, client_secret, and entity_id. This will automatically handle the 
authentication and setup for API requests.

### Parameters

| Name          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `base_url`     | The root URL of the API (e.g., `{API_ROOT_URL}`)                          |
| `client_id`    | Your client ID provided by FairFood Connect (e.g., `{CLIENT_ID}`)         |
| `client_secret`| Your client secret provided by FairFood Connect (e.g., `{CLIENT_SECRET}`) |
| `entity_id`    | The entity ID for your account (e.g., `{ENTITY_ID}`)    

Once initialized, the connect object is ready to make API requests with the 
authentication token automatically included in the headers.

```python
from fairfood_connect.client import Connect

base_url = "{API_ROOT_URL}"
client_id = "{CLIENT_ID}"
client_secret = "{CLIENT_SECRET}"
entity_id = "{ENTITY_ID}"

connect = Connect(base_url, client_id, client_secret, entity_id)
```

#### Get Access Token

The Get Access Token is automatically handled during the initialization 
process. When you create an instance of the Connect class, the access 
token is automatically generated and included in the request headers for 
subsequent API calls. You don't need to manually fetch or pass the token.

We can obtain token by below code

```python
connect.authenticator.auth_token
```

#### Company Module

The Company Module allows you to interact with the company-related API 
endpoints. The get_details method is used to retrieve details of a specific 
company based on its unique identifier (company_id).

To get company details, you must provide the company_id of the company you 
want to retrieve information for. This ID is typically the unique identifier 
for the company in the system.

Arguments:
    company_id (str): The unique identifier for the company you want to fetch 
        details for. Replace "{ENTITY_ID}" with the actual company ID.

Returns:
    A dictionary containing the company's details, such as name, 
    address, contact information, and more, based on the available 
    data for the provided company ID.

```python
connect.companies.get_details(company_id="{ENTITY_ID}")
```

#### Product Module

The Product Module allows you to interact with the product-related API 
endpoints. The list method is used to retrieve a list of products. 
You can specify the number of products to retrieve by using limit and 
offset, although these are optional parameters. If not provided, 
the default limit is 10, and the default offset is 0.

limit (int)(optional): The maximum number of products to retrieve 
    (default is 10).
offset (int)(optional): The number of products to skip before starting to 
    return results (default is 0)

Returns:
    A dictionary containing a list of products, including details such as 
    product name, ID, description, etc.

```python
connect.products.list(limit=20, offset=10)
```

#### Catalog Module

The Catalog Module provides methods to interact with catalog-related API 
endpoints, specifically for retrieving lists of countries and provinces.

**List Countries**

    The list_countries method retrieves a list of all available countries.
    Returns a dictionary containing a list of countries with relevant details.

    ```python
    connect.catalogs.list_countries()
    ```

**List Countries with Provinces**

    The list_countries_with_provinces method retrieves a list of countries 
    along with their associated provinces. Returns a dictionary containing a 
    list of countries, each with its respective provinces.

    ```python
    connect.catalogs.list_countries_with_provinces()
    ```

**List Provinces by Country**
    The list_provinces_by_country method retrieves the list of provinces 
    for a specific country. You must pass the country_name as an argument 
    to specify which country’s provinces to retrieve.

    Arguments:
        country_name (str): The name of the country whose provinces you 
            want to list. Replace "{country_name}" with the actual 
            country name.

    Returns: 
        A dictionary containing a list of provinces for the specified 
        country.

    ```python
    connect.catalogs.list_provinces_by_country(country_name="{country_name}")  
    ```

#### Farmer Module
