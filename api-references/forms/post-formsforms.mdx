sidebarTitle: Add Additional Fields Using Forms
description: The Create Form endpoint allows users to create a new form for transaction processing. Forms are used to add extra fields to store data while adding data to a resource. Different form types are available to specify the resources for the form. Field configurations can be added to customize the form's behavior. The request should include details such as form ID, fields, field configuration, form type, and ownership information. The response provides the created form's details, including form ID, associated products, fields, field configuration, update and creation timestamps, form type, and ownership information. This form can be used in transaction-related activities within the Connect system.
