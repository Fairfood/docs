### Mission


We offer innovative solutions that enable agri-food businesses to improve their responsible business practices. Open and attainable solutions that are designed to democratise the world of food. We actively engage all supply chain actors involved – from farmer to retailer and consumer – aiming to contribute to the socio-economic prosperity of farmers and food workers. Fairfood believes in partnerships to jointly accelerate the change towards a sustainable food system.


We can trace back the history of a product, we could identify some deep-rooted issues that the people at the beginning of the chain are facing. Issues like poverty and unfair pricing are real problems that need to be addressed. In bigger letters, we want to use traceability as a starting point to make sure that the people behind our food can earn a living income.


With transparency, we deduce a food supply chain that ceases to be opaque; one in which everyone can see where their food is coming from, by who it was harvested, and whether that someone got a fair price for their produce. Then, we proceed to the following question: do those people earn enough money to make a living income or wage?


We want to use the transparency that blockchain enables to help consumers answer that question and pick their food consciously. Is your food brand claiming to be paying a fair price to their farmers? Why not check for yourself. This is what we want to achieve: a food system in which consumers can verify veracity for themselves so that it can benefit those who cannot.


we realised that one way to make a direct change in our food system is by helping businesses to implement traceability and transparency in their supply chains. We want to drive sustainable change from the inside. The mission remains the same, however: to use our technology to the benefit of those who are at an obvious disadvantage in a long and complex supply chain. This means that campaigning is no longer our core business. Nonetheless, when needed we will not be afraid to take a stand!


### Personality



We are a long-term partner for frontrunning companies looking to transition towards fair and sustainable supply chains. Our joint journey is built on the pillars of traceability, transparency and first-mile digitisation. 


Fairfood delivers hands-on solutions that deliver value for all stakeholders involved in food production. Farmers gain access to new market information, and learn about clients’ needs. Brands and retailers develop a better understanding of their supply chain, and can back up sustainability claims with robust data. Consumers can judge for themselves if the product is sustainable and fair.


Everyone profits from improved trust and connectivity among the different supply chain partners, fostering sustainable business relationships.


### Promise



We enable 100% traceability from verified smallholder farmers through an end-to-end technology platform. Associate sustainability data with traceable foods and back up your claims on living incomes, fair value or carbon-neutral production. Trace and verify payments to farmers.
