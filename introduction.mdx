## What is Trace?

Trace is an easy-to-use blockchain-based platform that allows agri-food businesses to make their supply chain transparent and trace their products from farm-to-fork.

   Our dashboard and public interfaces will help to understand more about the farmers and businesses in your food chain, the current whereabouts of products, and the extent to which brand promises have been met.

   The food collectors in the chain can use the application without the internet to onboard farmers and record transactions. It enabled a new gateway to interact with the farmers in the chain using NFC-based cards.

## How does Trace work?

Trace is an easy-to-use blockchain-based platform that allows agri-food businesses to make their supply chain transparent and trace their products from farm-to-fork. Dive into case studies and learn more about Trace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover your chain">
  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/connect.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/connect.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
    Trace connects supply chain partners. You build up the chain digitally by inviting partners (1-up-1-down) until the first link – the farmer – is reached. Trace is easily accessible, even for smallholder farmers in low tech environments.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Trace your products">
   <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Every transaction for each product is registered, from the purchase at the farm gate until the final sale to the consumer. These transactions together form your product chain. Blockchain offers the possibility to safely store this data, while with Trace you can make the production chain transparent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify brand promises">
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Is your product organic? Did the farmer receive a fair price? Trace allows you to prove your promises. The proof can be shared with consumers. The blockchain tool Trace holds a library with a series of claims related to social, economic and environmental issues. Of course, we can develop a specific claim for your product.
  </Step>

   <Step title="Tell the whole story"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Trace is the final link in your storytelling. Through a link or QR-code that is placed on your product, consumers land on an interface where they can walk through the whole product history. Check out the story of Pure Africa coffee
  </Step>

   <Step title="Set ambitions and share added value"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    The ultimate goal: by providing you with new knowledge of your chain, Trace allows you to evaluate your sustainability ambitions. Moreover, discover to whom in your chain the newly transparent information adds value, and distribute that value proportionally across the chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>
