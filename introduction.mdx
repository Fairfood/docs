## What is Trace?

Trace is an easy-to-use blockchain-based platform that allows agri-food businesses to make their supply chain transparent and trace their products from farm-to-fork.

## How does Trace work?

Trace is an easy-to-use blockchain-based platform that allows agri-food businesses to make their supply chain transparent and trace their products from farm-to-fork. Dive into case studies and learn more about Trace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover your chain">
  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/img/connections.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/img/connections-b.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
    Trace connects supply chain partners. You build up the chain digitally by inviting partners (1-up-1-down) until the first link – the farmer – is reached. Trace is easily accessible, even for smallholder farmers in low tech environments.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Trace your products">
   <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/storytelling/product.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/storytelling/product-b.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Every transaction for each product is registered, from the purchase at the farm gate until the final sale to the consumer. These transactions together form your product chain. Blockchain offers the possibility to safely store this data, while with Trace you can make the production chain transparent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify brand promises">
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
   src="/images/storytelling/brand-b-1.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/storytelling/brand-b.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Is your product organic? Did the farmer receive a fair price? Trace allows you to prove your promises. The proof can be shared with consumers. The blockchain tool Trace holds a library with a series of claims related to social, economic and environmental issues. Of course, we can develop a specific claim for your product.
  </Step>

   <Step title="Tell the whole story"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/storytelling/chain.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/storytelling/chain-b.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Trace is the final link in your storytelling. Through a link or QR-code that is placed on your product, consumers land on an interface where they can walk through the whole product history. Check out the story of Pure Africa coffee

   <Step title="Set ambitions and share added value"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/img/dashboard.png"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/img/dashboard-b.png"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    The ultimate goal: by providing you with new knowledge of your chain, Trace allows you to evaluate your sustainability ambitions. Moreover, discover to whom in your chain the newly transparent information adds value, and distribute that value proportionally across the chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Who are we?

We are a non-profit organisation accelerating the transition towards a fair food system, one that defends the livelihoods of the people behind our food. Working in over 15 countries, we bring our expertise into decision-making spaces, continuously pushing for farmer inclusion and corporate accountability at all levels. 

#### We develop solutions that create value for people and the planet

Fairfood is a long-term partner for companies looking to transition towards fair and sustainable supply chains. They provide solutions that deliver value for all stakeholders involved in food production through traceability, transparency and digitization of the first-mile. This improves trust and connectivity among supply chain partners, fostering sustainable business relationships and benefiting farmers, brands, retailers and consumers.

## Impact areas

Defining the areas in which our partnerships aim to make an impact. 



<Steps>
  <Step title="Fair Value Distribution">
  <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/fairvalue.png" width="45%"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/fairvalue.png"  width="45%"
  alt="connection"
/>
    Fairfood aims to redistribute value along food supply chains, with the purpose of enhancing farmers’ and workers’ incomes and livelihoods. We want to demonstrate that this fairness can be a win-win for all stakeholders; as farmers gain a higher income, companies can profit from future-proofing their business.
  </Step>


  <Step title="Transparent supply chains">
   <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/trans.png" width="45%"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
 src="/images/trans.png" width="45%"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Supply chain transparency ultimately serves corporate accountability. For too long, misconducts have been hidden behind opaque food supply chains. By making them transparent, we put a spotlight on farmers’ and workers’ rights, allowing businesses to back up the promises they make about social and environmental sustainability, and consumers to dig into the true story behind their products.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Living wage & income">
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/lwl.png" width="45%"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/lwl.png" width="45%"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Poverty is a driving force behind a lot of the issues in agri-food; it has been connected to child labour, deforestation and unsustainable agricultural practices. Yet, this fundamental issue is astonishingly complex in and of itself. To make the solution measurable, Fairfood is looking at the concept of living wages and incomes, which should allow workers and farmers to afford a decent standard of living.
  </Step>

   <Step title="Digital inclusion"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/digital.png" width="50%"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/digital.png" width="50%"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>
    Global crises demand corporate accountability. As companies need a more profound understanding of their impact on people and planet, they are turning to digital solutions, which often demand data collection at farm level. Fairfood envisions a future where everyone benefits from this digitisation. We put the farmer at the centre of all data processes, to ultimately have them benefit of the value these processes add to the final product.
  </Step>

   <Step title="Climate"> 
     <img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/climate.png" width="50%"
  alt="connection"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/climate.png" width="50%"

    Carbon insetting : Insetting is when a company reduces CO2 within its supply chain. They support farmers to plant trees and adopt climate-resilient practices, selling carbon credits for income. A new program with Solidaridad, Cool Farm Alliance, &ranj, Rabobank, and 12.7 million euros from the Dutch Postcode Lottery aims to achieve this.


Climate claims: Claim attestation is a central function of our main solution Trace. Climate claims are relatively new to Fairfood and we're currently in the process of defining which climate claims we can support within our solutions. 'No deforestation' will most likely be a key climate claim we'll support.
